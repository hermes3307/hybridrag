## 1. Basic Vector Operations

### 1.1 Get Embedding for a Face
```sql
SELECT face_id, embedding
FROM faces
WHERE face_id = 'your_face_id_here'
LIMIT 1;
```

### 1.2 Check Embedding Dimension
```sql
SELECT face_id,
       array_length(embedding, 1) as dimension,
       embedding_model
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

### 1.3 Count Vectors by Model
```sql
SELECT embedding_model,
       COUNT(*) as total_vectors
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY embedding_model
ORDER BY total_vectors DESC;
```

### 1.4 Find Faces Without Embeddings
```sql
SELECT face_id, file_path, created_at
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 1.5 Get Random Face with Embedding
```sql
SELECT face_id, file_path, embedding
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 1;
```

---

## 2. Distance Metrics Explained

### 2.1 Cosine Distance (`<=>`)
**Best for:** Normalized vectors, semantic similarity
**Range:** 0 (identical) to 2 (opposite)
**Use when:** Direction matters more than magnitude

```sql
-- Find similar faces using cosine distance
SELECT face_id, gender, brightness,
       embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id')::vector AS cosine_distance
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND face_id != 'query_face_id'
ORDER BY cosine_distance
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2.2 L2/Euclidean Distance (`<->`)
**Best for:** Geometric distance, spatial similarity
**Range:** 0 (identical) to infinity
**Use when:** Absolute distance matters

```sql
-- Find similar faces using L2 distance
SELECT face_id, gender, brightness,
       embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id')::vector AS l2_distance
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND face_id != 'query_face_id'
ORDER BY l2_distance
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2.3 Inner Product (`<#>`)
**Best for:** Dot product similarity, magnitude-aware
**Range:** Negative (dissimilar) to positive (similar)
**Use when:** Both direction and magnitude matter

```sql
-- Find similar faces using inner product
SELECT face_id, gender, brightness,
       embedding <#> (SELECT embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id')::vector AS inner_product
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND face_id != 'query_face_id'
ORDER BY inner_product
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2.4 Compare All Three Metrics
```sql
WITH query_embedding AS (
    SELECT embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id'
)
SELECT face_id, gender,
       embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_embedding) AS cosine_dist,
       embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM query_embedding) AS l2_dist,
       embedding <#> (SELECT embedding FROM query_embedding) AS inner_prod
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND face_id != 'query_face_id'
ORDER BY cosine_dist
LIMIT 10;
```

WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND face_id != 'query_face_id'
  AND embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM query_embedding) < 0.5  -- Threshold
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3.3 Similarity Search Excluding Self
```sql
-- Ensure query face is excluded from results
WITH query_face AS (
    SELECT face_id, embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id'
)
SELECT f.face_id, f.gender, f.brightness,
       f.embedding <=> q.embedding AS distance
FROM faces f, query_face q
WHERE f.embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND f.face_id != q.face_id
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3.4 Batch Similarity Search (Multiple Queries)
```sql

WITH query_faces AS (
    SELECT face_id, embedding
    FROM faces
    WHERE face_id IN ('face_id_1', 'face_id_2', 'face_id_3')
)
SELECT qf.face_id as query_face,
       f.face_id as similar_face,
       f.gender,
       f.embedding <=> qf.embedding AS distance
FROM faces f
CROSS JOIN query_faces qf

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Create Vector Index (HNSW - Recommended)
```sql
-- Create index for fast similarity search
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS faces_embedding_hnsw_idx
ON faces
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- For L2 distance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS faces_embedding_l2_idx
ON faces
USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

### 6.2 Create IVFFlat Index (Alternative)
```sql
-- Create IVFFlat index (faster build, slower search)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS faces_embedding_ivfflat_idx
ON faces
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);
```

### 6.3 Analyze Query Performance
```sql
-- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to check query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT face_id,
       embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM faces WHERE face_id = 'query_face_id')::vector AS distance
FROM faces
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 10;
```

### 6.4 Set Vector Search Parameters
```sql
-- Adjust HNSW search parameters (session-level)
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;  -- Higher = more accurate but slower

-- Reset to default
RESET hnsw.ef_search;
```

### 6.5 Vacuum and Analyze
```sql
-- Optimize table and update statistics
VACUUM ANALYZE faces;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'faces';
```

CROSS JOIN bright_faces bf
WHERE f.embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND f.face_id != bf.face_id
  AND f.embedding <=> bf.embedding < 0.3
ORDER BY bf.face_id, distance;
```

## ðŸ“Š Quick Reference

### Distance Operators
- `<=>` Cosine distance (0-2, lower = more similar)
- `<->` L2/Euclidean distance (0-âˆž, lower = more similar)
- `<#>` Inner product (-âˆž to âˆž, higher = more similar)

### Common Thresholds (Cosine Distance)
- `< 0.1` - Very similar (potential duplicates)
- `< 0.3` - Similar (same person or very similar features)
- `< 0.5` - Somewhat similar (similar demographic)
- `> 0.5` - Different

### Index Types
- **HNSW** - Best for most cases (accurate + fast)
- **IVFFlat** - Good for very large datasets

### Performance Tips
1. Always create indexes on embedding column
2. Use LIMIT to restrict results
3. Add WHERE filters before ORDER BY
4. Use CTEs for complex queries
5. Run VACUUM ANALYZE regularly
